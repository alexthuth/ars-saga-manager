# Ars Saga Manager Testing Strategy

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Ars Saga Manager application. It covers different types of tests, their purposes, and guidelines for implementation.

## 2. Types of Tests

### 2.1 Unit Tests
- Purpose: Test individual components, functions, and modules in isolation.
- Tools: Jest, React Testing Library
- Coverage goal: 80% code coverage

### 2.2 Integration Tests
- Purpose: Test interactions between different parts of the application.
- Tools: Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest (for API testing)
- Focus: API integrations, database operations, complex component interactions

### 2.3 End-to-End Tests
- Purpose: Test complete user flows and scenarios.
- Tools: Cypress
- Coverage: Key user journeys (e.g., character creation, login flow)

### 2.4 Snapshot Tests
- Purpose: Detect unintended changes in UI components.
- Tools: Jest
- Coverage: All reusable UI components

## 3. Test Organization

### 3.1 Frontend Tests
- Place test files next to the component or module they're testing.
- Use the naming convention `[ComponentName].test.js`.
- Group tests using `describe` blocks for better organization.

### 3.2 Backend Tests
- Create a `__tests__` directory in each module (e.g., `routes`, `models`, `utils`).
- Use the naming convention `[ModuleName].test.js`.
- Separate unit tests and integration tests into different files if necessary.

## 4. Best Practices
- Write descriptive test names using the "it should..." format.
- Use setup and teardown functions (`beforeEach`, `afterEach`) to maintain a clean test environment.
- Mock external dependencies and API calls.
- Use factories or fixtures to generate test data.
- Aim for test independence - tests should not rely on the state from other tests.

## 5. Continuous Integration
- Run all tests on every pull request.
- Integrate with GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD tool.
- Enforce minimum code coverage requirements before merging.

## 6. Performance Testing
- Implement load testing for critical API endpoints using tools like Apache JMeter or k6.
- Monitor and set performance budgets for frontend components.

## 7. Accessibility Testing
- Integrate accessibility checks using tools like jest-axe.
- Ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## 8. Security Testing
- Implement security scans using tools like OWASP ZAP.
- Regularly update and scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## 9. Maintenance
- Review and update tests regularly, especially after major feature additions or changes.
- Refactor tests as needed to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
