# Ars Saga Manager System Architecture


The Ars Saga Manager is a web-based application with a client-server architecture, consisting of two main components: a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend. The system follows a typical three-tier architecture: presentation layer, application layer, and data layer.

1. Frontend (Presentation Layer)
Built with React, utilizing modern JavaScript features
Uses React Router for client-side routing
Implements a responsive design with Tailwind CSS for styling
Communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls using Axios
Key components:
Authentication system (login, registration, password reset)
Character management (creation, listing, editing)
Character sheet with multiple tabs for different aspects of characters
2. Backend (Application Layer)
Node.js with Express.js framework
RESTful API endpoints for user authentication and character management
JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication
Sequelize ORM for database interactions
Key features:
User authentication and authorization with detailed password reset functionality
Character CRUD operations with validation and error handling
Simulated email service for password reset (for development)
3. Database (Data Layer)
PostgreSQL database
Managed through Sequelize ORM
Complex database configuration with different roles (superuser, developer, and app user)
Tables: users, characters, reference_virtues_flaws, character_virtues_flaws
4. Development and Deployment
Uses environment variables for configuration (see backend/config/database.js)
Implements comprehensive migrations for database schema management, including role creation and table setup
Includes seeding scripts for initial data population (e.g., virtues and flaws)
5. Security Measures
Password hashing using bcrypt
JWT for secure authentication
CORS enabled for cross-origin resource sharing
6. Architecture Patterns
MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern in the backend
Component-based architecture in the React frontend
Separation of concerns between frontend and backend
Use of middleware for authentication and error handling
7. API Design
RESTful API design principles
JSON data format for request and response bodies
Detailed error handling and validation in API endpoints
8. State Management
React's built-in state management (useState, useEffect hooks)
Custom authentication hook (useAuth) for managing user sessions
Implementation Steps
Set up the frontend React application with the necessary components and routing.
Implement the backend Express server with the required API endpoints.
Set up the PostgreSQL database and configure Sequelize ORM with appropriate roles and permissions.
4. Implement user authentication and authorization on both frontend and backend.
Develop the character management features, ensuring proper data flow between frontend and backend.
Implement proper error handling and validation throughout the application.
7. Set up environment-specific configurations for development and production.
Run migrations and seeders to set up the initial database state.
This architecture provides a scalable and maintainable structure for the Ars Saga Manager application, allowing for easy expansion of features and efficient management of character data for the Ars Magica role-playing game.
